# quarantine-go
A project I made during the lockdown.

To run locally, change the IP address in the script.js file to the IP address of the server.

The stuff in the docs/ directory is all for the offline version hosted on my GitHub pages, at https://andrewdongandy.github.io/quarantine-go/

TODO:
- allow a player to pass
- better connection interface, e.g.:
  - don't force connection order
  - allow more than 2 people at a time
- better "invalid move" alert, e.g. include reason
