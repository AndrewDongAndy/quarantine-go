# quarantine-go
A project I made during the lockdown.

To run locally, change the IP address in the script.js file to the IP address of the server.

The stuff in the docs/ directory is all for the offline version hosted on my GitHub pages, at https://andrewdongandy.github.io/quarantine-go/

TODO:
- don't allow suicidal moves
- enforce Ko rule (don't allow taking back and forth)
